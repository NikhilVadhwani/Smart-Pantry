## 🧠 What is Smart Pantry?

Smart Pantry is a simple menu-driven Python program that helps users decide  
**what they can cook based on the ingredients they already have.**

It compares your pantry items with a recipe database and tells you:

- ✔ Which recipes are ready to make  
- ❗ Which ingredients are missing  
- 🥗 Filter recipes by Veg / Non-Veg / Diet  
- 📋 Simple and easy interface  

Designed specially for **first-year CSE students**, it uses only fundamental Python concepts.
